While web surveys are generally cheaper and tend to have lower measurement error in comparison to other survey modes, especially for sensitive questions, potential advantages might be offset by larger nonresponse bias. This article compares the data quality in a web survey administration to another common mode of survey administration, the telephone.The unique feature of this study is the availability of administrative records for all sampled individuals in combination with a random assignment of survey mode. This specific design allows us to investigate and compare potential bias in survey statistics due to 1) nonresponse error, 2) measurement error, and 3) combined bias of these two error sources and hence, an overall assessment of data quality for two common modes of survey administration, telephone and web.Our results show that overall mean estimates on the web are more biased compared to the telephone mode. Nonresponse and measurement bias tend to reinforce each other in both modes, with nonresponse bias being somewhat more pronounced in the web mode. While measurement error bias tends to be smaller in the web survey implementation, interestingly, our results also show that the web does not consistently outperform the telephone mode","","","","","","","","","","",""

The validity of HBS data, however, is not well established. The aim of this project was to compare HBS and individual nutrition survey (INS) data in a nationally representative sample of Polish households. DESIGN: Estimates of food consumption and nutrient intake were compared between household food acquisition data collected over 1 month and a single 24-hour recall collected from every household member in a nationally representative sample of Polish households surveyed between September and November 2000. To facilitate the comparison, INS food consumption data excluded food eaten away from home and were modified using a computer program to estimate food 'as purchased' (including disaggregation of recipe data) and to allow for wastage. SETTING: Poland. SUBJECTS: Participants were 3716 individuals in 1215 households (representing co-operation rates of 86.2% and 89.2%, respectively). RESULTS: Good agreement was shown between median estimates of foods such as potatoes, vegetables (including processed), meat, meat products and poultry, and animal fats (excluding butter), but agreement was poor for bread and rolls, fruit, vegetable fats and oils, eggs and six other food groups. Estimates of energy and nutrient intake were within +/-10% with the exceptions of polyunsaturated fats, potassium and vitamin C. CONCLUSIONS: Possible reasons for differences in findings between the two surveys include survey bias (e.g. social approval bias leading to overreporting of fruit), seasonal variations (e.g. high potato purchases between September and November) and aspects of the methodology (e.g. HBS data were based on records collected over 1 month, whereas 24-hour recall data were based on recalls collected from all household respondents on only 1 day and averaged for each household type). HBSs provide useful data for epidemiological research, but findings need to be interpreted in the light of other data regarding consumption, and numerous factors that may affect consumption need to be taken into account.","","","","Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, King's College London, 150 Stamford Street, London SE1 9NH, UK.","en","Research Article","","","","",""

The results strengthen the assumption that hard facts like daily travel show no substantial mode measurement effects and mixed mode surveys improve the coverage of the target population. But beside the envisaged mode selection effects that result in a better coverage of the target population we also identified indications for survey mode measurement effects concerning the number of reported trips. The authors intend to raise awareness of the advantages of elaborated mixed mode survey designs and to contribute to a sound discussion of mode measurement effects in transport surveys.","National travel survey; mixed mode survey; analysis of survey mode effects; survey mode preference","","","","","","","","","",""

This can negatively affect data quality, leading to less detailed and/or inaccurate activity reporting as the surveyed time period unfolds. However, it can also be argued that data quality may actually improve over time as respondents become more familiar with the diary instrument format and more interested in the diary task. These competing hypotheses have only been partially tested on data from paper and telephone-administered diaries, which are traditionally used for large-scale data collection. Less is known about self-administered modes that make use of new technologies, despite their increasing popularity among researchers. This research note rectifies this omission by comparing diary quality in self-administered web and app diaries, drawing on data from the Millennium Cohort Study. We construct a person-level data quality typology, using information on missing data, episode changes, and reporting of key daily activity domains. Results show significant mode differences on person-level data quality, after controlling for characteristics known to influence diary mode selection and data quality. App diarists were more likely to return two diaries of inconsistent quality. Both respondent fatigue and improvement of completion over time appear more common among app diarists.","","","","","","","","","","",""

The method combines the advantages of personal intercept interviews and online questionnaires to meet the basic requirements of a survey: good data quality, representativeness and minimal costs. Five application case studies in European cities are presented to evaluate and demonstrate the validity of the method and to study people’s willingness to complete a survey. The successful application of the method in a variety of research projects proves its validity for survey campaigns to assess different transport policies. The results evidence the validity of the methodology. The response rates obtained were quite high compared with merely online surveys – between 14 and 22% – and the data collected met the quality requirements for each research project where the method was applied. The method combines low cost, reliability and high response rates and therefore clearly contributes to mobility survey performance and sampling practices in transport research.","Mixed survey method; Intercept and web survey; Response rate; Data collection","","","","","","","","","",""

We argue that every challenge must be duly overcome in the international community to bring new statistical products based on these sources. These challenges can be naturally classified into different entangled issues regarding access to data, statistical methodology, quality, information technologies, and management.

The project showcases different applications of this concept relevant to the assessment of human activity at European scale. Underpinning each application in the thesis is the research question: How can geospatial data from diverse sources and with different properties be combined to enhance the spatial representation of human activity? The thesis focuses on developing an ensemble of data fusion protocols to integrate geospatial data from both conventional and unconventional data sources with very different characteristics into consistent data frameworks to fill specific data, information and knowledge gaps. Within the geospatial sciences, data fusion has been used mainly in the remote sensing domain. This project tries to unlock the potential of data fusion for a broader set of geographical information science applications, with focus areas on land use (Chapters 2, 3, 4), sector-specific activities (Chapters 5, 6) and population distribution (Chapters 7, 8).

But there are also many challenges: uncontrolled changes in sources that threaten continuity, lack of identifiers that impedes linking to population frames, and data that refers only indirectly to phenomena of statistical interest. We discuss two approaches to deal with these challenges and opportunities. First, we may accept big data for what they are: an imperfect, yet timely, indicator of phenomena in society. These data exist and that's whythey are interesting. Secondly, we may extend this approach by explicitmodelling. New methods like machine-learning techniques can be considered alongside more traditional methods like Bayesian techniques. National statistical institutes have always been reluctant to use models, apart from specific cases like small-area estimates. Based on the experience at Statistics Netherlands we argue that NSIs should not be afraid to use models, provided that their use is documented and made transparent to users. Moreover, the primary purpose of an NSI is to describe society; we should refrain from making forecasts. The models used should therefore rely on actually observed data and they should be validated extensively.","","","","Innovation Program, Statistics Netherlands, 2490 HA Den Haag, The Netherlands; Methods and Statistical Policies, Statistics Netherlands, 2490 HA Den Haag, The Netherlands","","","","","","",""

We assess sixteen sources of urban transportation and environmental big data that are published as open data or were made available to the project for Dublin, Ireland. These data were systematically explored through a process of data checking and wrangling, building tools to display and analyse the data, and evaluating them with respect to 16 measures of their suitability: access, sustainability and reliability, transparency and interpretability, privacy, fidelity, cleanliness, completeness, spatial granularity, temporal granularity, spatial coverage, coherence, metadata availability, changes over time, standardisation, methodological transparency, and relevance. We assessed how the data could be used to produce key performance indicators and potential new official statistics. Our analysis reveals that, at present, a limited set of smart city data is suitable for creating new official statistics, though others could potentially be made suitable with changes to data management. If these new official statistics are to be realised then National Statistical Institutions need to work closely with those organisations generating the data to try and implement a robust set of procedures and standards that will produce consistent, long-term data sets.","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional data sources, namely survey and administrative data, represent nowadays a valuable but small portion of the global data stock, much thereof being held in the private sector. The availability of new data sources is only one aspect of the global change that concerns official statistics. Other aspects, more subtle but not less important, include the changes in perceptions, expectations, behaviours and relations between the stakeholders. The environment around official statistics has changed: statistical offices are not any more data monopolists, but one prominent species among many others in a larger (and complex) ecosystem. What was established in the traditional world of legacy data sources (in terms of regulations, technologies, practices, etc.) is not guaranteed to be sufficient any more with new data sources. Trusted Smart Statistics is not about replacing existing sources and processes, but augmenting them with new ones. Such augmentation however will not be only incremental: the path towards Trusted Smart Statistics is not about tweaking some components of the legacy system but about building an entirely new system that will coexist with the legacy one. In this position paper we outline some key design principles for the new Trusted Smart Statistics system. Taken collectively they picture a system where the smart and trust aspects enable and reinforce each other. A system that is more extrovert towards external stakeholders (citizens, private companies, public authorities) with whom Statistical Offices will be sharing computation, control, code, logs and of course final statistics, without necessarily sharing the raw input data.","","","","","","","","","","",""

TSS represents the evolution of official statistics in response to the challenges posed by the new datafied society. Taking stock from the availability of new digital data sources, new technologies, and new behaviors, statistical offices are called nowadays to rethink the way they operate in order to reassert their role in modern democratic society. The issue at stake is considerably broader and deeper than merely adapting existing processes to embrace so-called Big Data. In several aspects, such evolution entails a fundamental paradigm shift with respect to the legacy model of official statistics production based on traditional data sources, for example, in the relation between data and computation, between data collection and analysis, between methodological development and statistical production, and of course in the roles of the various stakeholders and their mutual relationships. Such complex evolution must be guided by a comprehensive system-level view based on clearly spelled design principles. In this paper, we aim at providing a general account of the TSS concept reflecting the current state of the discussion within the European Statistical System.","Big Data; official statistics; Trusted Smart Statistics","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent developments in the past decade have shown how rapidly data ecosystems are evolving across our globalised and digitalised societies. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 represented a turning point for innovation in the ESS. The speed of change spiked: those NSIs that had established a solid ground for innovation managed to continue providing high quality statistics to society and policymakers, while exploiting the potential for innovation given by the availability of new data sources. Despite the pandemic slowly losing its grip, Europe has found itself in the middle of a new crisis with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Therefore, NSIs now face the challenge of keeping up the innovative work and rolling out these innovations into production. This paper provides an overview of the work on innovation done at the ESS level in recent years and its contribution to the resilience of the statistical system to respond to recent crises. Furthermore, taking stock of recent experiences, it presents some of the main challenges and enablers which are needed to sustain ESS innovation in the years to come.","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we present a multi-layered dasymetric approach that combines official statistics with geospatial data from emerging sources to produce and validate a European Union-wide dataset of population grids taking into account intraday and monthly population variations at 1 km2 resolution.

To do this, one-off studies with concrete data sets are not enough and a standard statistical production process must be put in place. We propose a concrete modular process structured into evolvable modules detaching the strongly technological layer underlying this data source from the necessary statistical analysis producing outputs of interest. This architecture follows the principles of the so-called ESS Reference Methodological Framework for Mobile Network Data. Each of these modules deals with a different aspect of this data source. We apply hidden Markov models for the geolocation of mobile devices, use a Bayesian approach on this model to disambiguate devices belonging to the same individual, compute aggregate numbers of individuals detected by a telecommunication network using probability theory, and model hierarchically the integration of auxiliary information from the telco market and official data to produce final estimates of the number of individuals across different territorial regions in the target population. A first simple illustrative proposal has been applied to synthetic data providing preliminary software tools and accuracy indicators monitoring the performance of the process. Currently, this exercise has been applied to the estimation of present population and origin-destination matrices. We present an illustrative example of the execution of these production modules comparing results with the simulated ground truth, thus assessing the performance of each production module.","","","","","en","","","","","",""

It is crucial, nevertheless, to understand its limitations. Although some research have explored the potential errors of metered data, a systematic categorisation and conceptualisation of these errors are missing. Inspired by the Total Survey Error, we present a Total Error framework for digital traces collected with Meters (TEM). The TEM framework (1) describes the data generation and the analysis process for metered data and (2) documents the sources of bias and variance that may arise in each step of this process. Using a case study we also show how the TEM can be applied in real life to identify, quantify and reduce metered data errors. Results suggest that metered data might indeed be affected by the error sources identified in our framework and, to some extent, biased. This framework can help improve the quality of both stand-alone metered data research projects, as well as foster the understanding of how and when survey and metered data can be combined.","digital trace data; error framework; metered data; passive data; total survey error; web‐tracking","","","Department of Methodology The London School of Economics and Political Science London UK.

We highlight how digital traces about human mobility can assist policy-making in relation to issues such as health or the environment differently to migration policy, where digital data can lead to stereotyped categorizations, unless analysis is carefully tailored to account for people’s real needs. In a world where people move for myriad reasons and these reasons may vary quickly without being incorporated in digital traces, we encourage researchers to constantly assess if what is being measured reflects the social phenomenon that the measurement is intended to capture and avoids rendering people visible in ways that are damaging to their rights and freedoms.","","","","","","","","","","",""

Almost half of the SDG indicators are not regularly produced, and available datasets are often out-of-date. New monitoring approaches using big data are advancing rapidly and can complement official statistics to help fill critical data gaps. However, there is poor information-sharing on the latest innovations and research collaborations across different thematic areas, and limited evaluation of strengths and weaknesses for supporting national monitoring. This paper provides a systematic review of the academic literature over the past 5 years relating to the use of big data to support monitoring of the SDGs. It reviews the state-of-the-art research using big data and advanced analytics to produce new datasets, the alignment of these datasets with the official SDG indicators, the main types and sources of big data used, and the analytical methods applied. We developed a set of evaluation criteria and applied it to highlight some of the strengths and limitations of these datasets derived from big data. We find that recent research has developed a considerable range of new datasets that could contribute to monitoring 15 goals, 51 targets, and 69 indicators. Dominant focal areas of research include land and biodiversity, health, water, cities and settlements, and poverty. Satellite and Earth Observation data were the primary sources used, most commonly applied with machine learning methods and cloud computing. However, several challenges remain, including ensuring the relevance of new datasets for monitoring SDG indicators, cost and accessibility considerations, sustainability aspects, and linking global datasets to nationally owned monitoring processes.","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the enthusiasm linked to this revolution, one of the main outstanding criticisms in using these data is selection bias. Indeed, the reference population is unknown. Nevertheless, many studies show evidence that these data constitute a valuable source because they are more timely and possess higher space granularity. We propose to adjust statistics based on Twitter data by anchoring them to reliable official statistics through a weighted, space-time, small area estimation model. As a by-product, the proposed method also stabilizes the social media indicators, which is a welcome property required for official statistics. The method can be adapted anytime official statistics exists at the proper level of granularity and for which social media usage within the population is known. As an example, we adjust a subjective well-being indicator of “working conditions” in Italy, and combine it with relevant official statistics. The weights depend on broadband coverage and the Twitter rate at province level, while the analysis is performed at regional level. The resulting statistics are then compared with survey statistics on the “quality of job” at macro-economic regional level, showing evidence of similar paths.","","","","","","","","","","",""

Not only is the selection mechanism often unknown but larger data volume amplifies the relative contribution of selection bias to total error. Existing bias adjustment approaches assume that the conditional mean structures have been correctly specified for the selection indicator or key substantive measures. In the presence of a reference probability sample, these methods rely on a pseudolikelihood method to account for the sampling weights of the reference sample, which is parametric in nature. Under a Bayesian framework, handling the sampling weights is an even bigger hurdle. To further protect against model misspecification, we expand the idea of double robustness such that more flexible nonparametric methods as well as Bayesian models can be used for prediction. In particular, we employ Bayesian additive regression trees which not only capture nonlinear associations automatically but permit direct quantification of the uncertainty of point estimates through its posterior predictive draws. We apply our method to sensor-based naturalistic driving data from the second Strategic Highway Research Program using the 2017 National Household Travel Survey as a benchmark.","augmented inverse propensity weighting; Bayesian additive regression trees; big data; doubly robust; nonprobability sample; prediction model; quasi-randomization; ","","","","en","","","","","",""

One of the fundamental aims of computer systems, and especially decision support systems, is to assure that the quality of the information they process is high. There are many different approaches for this purpose, including information fusion. Information fusion is currently one of the most promising methods. It is particularly useful under circumstances where quality might be compromised, for example, either intrinsically due to imperfect information (vagueness, uncertainty, …) or because of limited resources (energy, time, …). In response to this goal, a wide range of research has been undertaken over recent years. To date, the literature reviews in this field have focused on problem-specific issues and have been circumscribed to certain system types. Therefore, there is no holistic and systematic knowledge of the state of the art to help establish the steps to be taken in the future. In particular, aspects like what impact different information fusion methods have on information quality, how information quality is characterised, measured and evaluated in different application domains depending on the problem data type or whether fusion is designed as a flexible process capable of adapting to changing system circumstances and their intrinsically limited resources have not been addressed. This paper aims precisely to review the literature on research into the use of information fusion techniques specifically to improve information quality, analysing the above issues in order to identify a series of challenges and research directions, which are presented in this paper.","Information fusion; Information quality; Information imperfections; Sustainability","","","","","","","","","",""

This is remarkable, as in the meantime not only the availability of gambling services and the turnover and gross gambling revenues of gambling providers have increased, but also the demand for treatment from people with gambling problems has grown. Not only in the gambling field have population surveys of this type recently been associated with certain methodological problems. These include a decreasing willingness to participate among and limited access to specific subgroups. The prevalence study at hand is based on a mixed-mode design which combines both a telephone and an online survey. The weighting of both samples in a ratio of 2 to 1 was checked against plausibility data. The sample consists of 12,303 complete interviews (telephone: 61%, online: 39%). The results show that 2.3% of the German population aged 18?70?years are identified as having a ?gambling disorder? according to DSM-5 (mild disorder: 1.1%, moderate disorder: 0.7%, and severe disorder: 0.5%). The prevalence detected in this study is significantly higher than that of previous surveys. Finally, we discuss the results primarily within the context of the new survey methodology.","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nowadays, innovative data sources offer an opportunity to describe demographic, mobility, and migratory phenomena more accurately by making available large volumes of real-time and spatially detailed data. At the same time, however, data innovation has led to new challenges (ethics, privacy, data governance models, data quality) for citizens, statistical offices, policymakers and the private sector. Focusing on the fields of demography, mobility, and migration studies, the aim of this report is to assess the current state of data innovation in the scientific literature as well as to identify areas in which data innovation has the most concrete potential for policymaking. Consequently, this study has reviewed more than 300 articles and scientific reports, as well as numerous tools, that employed non-traditional data sources to measure vital population events (mortality, fertility), migration and human mobility, and the population change and population distribution. The specific findings of our report form the basis of a discussion on a) how innovative data is used compared to traditional data sources; b) domains in which innovative data have the greatest potential to contribute to policymaking; c) the prospects of innovative data transition towards systematically contributing to official statistics and policymaking.","","","","","","","arXiv","2209.05460","cs.CY","","arXiv [cs.CY]"

It is necessary to address this challenge as the entire domain gradually transitions into e-healthcare and patient-centered healthcare delivery models. The lack of data integration at systems level prohibits clinicians from building a comprehensive understanding of the patient condition and further deprives patients of developing a holistic awareness of their medical conditions. In this paper, we propose an open data integration platform for patient, clinical, medical and historical data siloed across multiple health information systems. As an open platform, it can accommodate and integrate further heterogeneous data sources such as data streams generated by wearable IoT devices. As an integration platform, it facilitates the centralization of data assets. This centralization empowers every stakeholder in a patient-centered care setting to actively participate in decision-making. A range of analytics and reporting solutions, such as data warehouse, interactive dashboards, and predictive analytics tools, can be deployed upon this open data integration platform. The proposed platform is currently being adapted and implemented to address patient-centered healthcare and clinical decision support requirements in a sports injury clinic at a not-for-profit private hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Use Case based demonstration of the platform’s suitability for holistic information management, decision support, and predictive analytics justify its role in the advancement of e-healthcare.","Data integration; e-healthcare platform; Patient-centered care; Clinical decision-support; Participatory medicine","","","","","","","","","",""
