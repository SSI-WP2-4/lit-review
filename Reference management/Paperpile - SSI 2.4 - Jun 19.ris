AB  - Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in the use of new
      technologies for time-use data collection, driven by their potential to
      reduce survey administration costs and improve data quality. However,
      despite the steady growth of studies that employ web and app time diaries,
      there is little research on their comparability with traditional
      paper-administered diaries that have long been regarded as the “gold
      standard” for measurement in time-use research. This paper investigates
      diary mode effects on data quality and measurement, drawing on data from a
      mixed-mode large-scale time diary study of adolescents in the United
      Kingdom. After controlling for observable characteristics associated with
      diary mode selection and adolescent time-use, we find that web and app
      diaries yield higher quality data than paper diaries, which attests to the
      potential of new technologies in facilitating diary completion. At the
      same time, our analysis of broad time-use domains does not find
      substantial mode effects on measurement for most daily activity
      categories. We conclude by discussing avenues for future methodological
      research and implications for time-use data collection.

AB  - AbstractMore and more surveys are conducted online. While web surveys are
      generally cheaper and tend to have lower measurement error in comparison
      to other survey modes, especially for sensitive questions, potential
      advantages might be offset by larger nonresponse bias. This article
      compares the data quality in a web survey administration to another common
      mode of survey administration, the telephone.The unique feature of this
      study is the availability of administrative records for all sampled
      individuals in combination with a random assignment of survey mode. This
      specific design allows us to investigate and compare potential bias in
      survey statistics due to 1) nonresponse error, 2) measurement error, and
      3) combined bias of these two error sources and hence, an overall
      assessment of data quality for two common modes of survey administration,
      telephone and web.Our results show that overall mean estimates on the web
      are more biased compared to the telephone mode. Nonresponse and
      measurement bias tend to reinforce each other in both modes, with
      nonresponse bias being somewhat more pronounced in the web mode. While
      measurement error bias tends to be smaller in the web survey
      implementation, interestingly, our results also show that the web does not
      consistently outperform the telephone mode

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Household budget survey (HBS) data are used regularly for
      nutritional epidemiological purposes. The validity of HBS data, however,
      is not well established. The aim of this project was to compare HBS and
      individual nutrition survey (INS) data in a nationally representative
      sample of Polish households. DESIGN: Estimates of food consumption and
      nutrient intake were compared between household food acquisition data
      collected over 1 month and a single 24-hour recall collected from every
      household member in a nationally representative sample of Polish
      households surveyed between September and November 2000. To facilitate the
      comparison, INS food consumption data excluded food eaten away from home
      and were modified using a computer program to estimate food 'as purchased'
      (including disaggregation of recipe data) and to allow for wastage.
      SETTING: Poland. SUBJECTS: Participants were 3716 individuals in 1215
      households (representing co-operation rates of 86.2% and 89.2%,
      respectively). RESULTS: Good agreement was shown between median estimates
      of foods such as potatoes, vegetables (including processed), meat, meat
      products and poultry, and animal fats (excluding butter), but agreement
      was poor for bread and rolls, fruit, vegetable fats and oils, eggs and six
      other food groups. Estimates of energy and nutrient intake were within
      +/-10% with the exceptions of polyunsaturated fats, potassium and vitamin
      C. CONCLUSIONS: Possible reasons for differences in findings between the
      two surveys include survey bias (e.g. social approval bias leading to
      overreporting of fruit), seasonal variations (e.g. high potato purchases
      between September and November) and aspects of the methodology (e.g. HBS
      data were based on records collected over 1 month, whereas 24-hour recall
      data were based on recalls collected from all household respondents on
      only 1 day and averaged for each household type). HBSs provide useful data
      for epidemiological research, but findings need to be interpreted in the
      light of other data regarding consumption, and numerous factors that may
      affect consumption need to be taken into account.

AB  - The paper analyzes the survey mode effects observed in the recent German
      national household travel survey “MiD 2017 – Mobility in Germany” with
      focus on the observed mobility behavior and survey mode preferences. In
      order to disentangle survey mode selection and survey mode measurement
      effects, multivariate regression models where used to control for
      socio-demographic factors. The results strengthen the assumption that hard
      facts like daily travel show no substantial mode measurement effects and
      mixed mode surveys improve the coverage of the target population. But
      beside the envisaged mode selection effects that result in a better
      coverage of the target population we also identified indications for
      survey mode measurement effects concerning the number of reported trips.
      The authors intend to raise awareness of the advantages of elaborated
      mixed mode survey designs and to contribute to a sound discussion of mode
      measurement effects in transport surveys.

AB  - The time-use diary is a complex and burdensome data collection instrument.
      This can negatively affect data quality, leading to less detailed and/or
      inaccurate activity reporting as the surveyed time period unfolds.
      However, it can also be argued that data quality may actually improve over
      time as respondents become more familiar with the diary instrument format
      and more interested in the diary task. These competing hypotheses have
      only been partially tested on data from paper and telephone-administered
      diaries, which are traditionally used for large-scale data collection.
      Less is known about self-administered modes that make use of new
      technologies, despite their increasing popularity among researchers. This
      research note rectifies this omission by comparing diary quality in
      self-administered web and app diaries, drawing on data from the Millennium
      Cohort Study. We construct a person-level data quality typology, using
      information on missing data, episode changes, and reporting of key daily
      activity domains. Results show significant mode differences on
      person-level data quality, after controlling for characteristics known to
      influence diary mode selection and data quality. App diarists were more
      likely to return two diaries of inconsistent quality. Both respondent
      fatigue and improvement of completion over time appear more common among
      app diarists.

AB  - Adopting new methods in large longstanding surveys, such as National
      Travel Surveys, is associated with specific challenges. Aside from
      methodological issues, the continuation of time series and data that is
      usable for many, are important concerns. Multi-mode surveys are becoming
      common place and new methods are run in parallel to established methods.
      This improves survey representativeness but there are new challenges, for
      example mode effects. The introduction and spread of smartphone use in
      surveys and emerging methods for recruiting survey participants will add
      to this complexity. As survey methods evolve, data post-processing and
      statistical methods have to keep up as well.

AB  - This paper presents a surveying method developed and tested in several
      data collection campaigns for different purposes in the field of urban
      mobility. The method combines the advantages of personal intercept
      interviews and online questionnaires to meet the basic requirements of a
      survey: good data quality, representativeness and minimal costs. Five
      application case studies in European cities are presented to evaluate and
      demonstrate the validity of the method and to study people’s willingness
      to complete a survey. The successful application of the method in a
      variety of research projects proves its validity for survey campaigns to
      assess different transport policies. The results evidence the validity of
      the methodology. The response rates obtained were quite high compared with
      merely online surveys – between 14 and 22% – and the data collected met
      the quality requirements for each research project where the method was
      applied. The method combines low cost, reliability and high response rates
      and therefore clearly contributes to mobility survey performance and
      sampling practices in transport research.

AB  - Mixed-mode surveys have become a standard at many statistical institutes.
      However, the introduction of multiple modes in one design goes with
      challenges to both methodology and logistics. Mode-specific representation
      and measurement differences become explicit and demand for solutions in
      data collection design, questionnaire design, and estimation. This is
      especially true when surveys are repeated and are input to long time
      series of official statistics. So how can statistical institutes deal with
      such changes? What are the origins of mode-specific error? And how can
      they be dealt with? In this book, the authors provide answers to these
      questions, and much more. Features Concise introduction to all the key
      elements of mixed-mode survey design and analysis Realistic official
      statistics examples from three general population surveys Suitable for
      survey managers and survey statisticians alike An overview of
      mode-specific representation and measurement errors and how to avoid,
      reduce and adjust them.

AB  - In the past years we have witnessed the rise of new data sources for the
      potential production of official statistics, which, by and large, can be
      classified as survey, administrative, and digital data. Apart from the
      differences in their generation and collection, we claim that their lack
      of statistical metadata, their economic value, and their lack of ownership
      by data holders pose several entangled challenges lurking the
      incorporation of new data into the routinely production of official
      statistics. We argue that every challenge must be duly overcome in the
      international community to bring new statistical products based on these
      sources. These challenges can be naturally classified into different
      entangled issues regarding access to data, statistical methodology,
      quality, information technologies, and management. We identify the most
      relevant to be necessarily tackled before new data sources can be
      definitively considered fully incorporated into the production of official
      statistics.

TI  - Geospatial data fusion for continental assessments of land use, activities

PY  - 2022

PB  - figshare
AB  - This thesis advances the use of geospatial data fusion as a means to
      bridge the gap between the conventional, yet limited, data sources and the
      geospatial data from emerging, unconventional, yet disparate, sources and
      formats. The project showcases different applications of this concept
      relevant to the assessment of human activity at European scale.
      Underpinning each application in the thesis is the research question: How
      can geospatial data from diverse sources and with different properties be
      combined to enhance the spatial representation of human activity? The
      thesis focuses on developing an ensemble of data fusion protocols to
      integrate geospatial data from both conventional and unconventional data
      sources with very different characteristics into consistent data
      frameworks to fill specific data, information and knowledge gaps. Within
      the geospatial sciences, data fusion has been used mainly in the remote
      sensing domain. This project tries to unlock the potential of data fusion
      for a broader set of geographical information science applications, with
      focus areas on land use (Chapters 2, 3, 4), sector-specific activities
      (Chapters 5, 6) and population distribution (Chapters 7, 8). The outcomes
      stretch beyond the production of fancier digital maps. The thesis
      synthesizes new information from structured data fusion approaches, where
      the results are more than the sum of the parts, allowing new insight about
      the spatial dimension of socio-economic phenomena, to ultimately feed
      decision-support tools.

AB  - Big data offers many opportunities for official statistics: for example
      increased resolution, better timeliness, and new statistical outputs. But
      there are also many challenges: uncontrolled changes in sources that
      threaten continuity, lack of identifiers that impedes linking to
      population frames, and data that refers only indirectly to phenomena of
      statistical interest. We discuss two approaches to deal with these
      challenges and opportunities. First, we may accept big data for what they
      are: an imperfect, yet timely, indicator of phenomena in society. These
      data exist and that's whythey are interesting. Secondly, we may extend
      this approach by explicitmodelling. New methods like machine-learning
      techniques can be considered alongside more traditional methods like
      Bayesian techniques. National statistical institutes have always been
      reluctant to use models, apart from specific cases like small-area
      estimates. Based on the experience at Statistics Netherlands we argue that
      NSIs should not be afraid to use models, provided that their use is
      documented and made transparent to users. Moreover, the primary purpose of
      an NSI is to describe society; we should refrain from making forecasts.
      The models used should therefore rely on actually observed data and they
      should be validated extensively.

AB  - AbstractIn this article we evaluate the viability of using big data
      produced by smart city systems for creating new official statistics. We
      assess sixteen sources of urban transportation and environmental big data
      that are published as open data or were made available to the project for
      Dublin, Ireland. These data were systematically explored through a process
      of data checking and wrangling, building tools to display and analyse the
      data, and evaluating them with respect to 16 measures of their
      suitability: access, sustainability and reliability, transparency and
      interpretability, privacy, fidelity, cleanliness, completeness, spatial
      granularity, temporal granularity, spatial coverage, coherence, metadata
      availability, changes over time, standardisation, methodological
      transparency, and relevance. We assessed how the data could be used to
      produce key performance indicators and potential new official statistics.
      Our analysis reveals that, at present, a limited set of smart city data is
      suitable for creating new official statistics, though others could
      potentially be made suitable with changes to data management. If these new
      official statistics are to be realised then National Statistical
      Institutions need to work closely with those organisations generating the
      data to try and implement a robust set of procedures and standards that
      will produce consistent, long-term data sets.

AB  - In this contribution we outline the concept of Trusted Smart Statistics as
      the natural evolution of official statistics in the new datafied world.
      Traditional data sources, namely survey and administrative data, represent
      nowadays a valuable but small portion of the global data stock, much
      thereof being held in the private sector. The availability of new data
      sources is only one aspect of the global change that concerns official
      statistics. Other aspects, more subtle but not less important, include the
      changes in perceptions, expectations, behaviours and relations between the
      stakeholders. The environment around official statistics has changed:
      statistical offices are not any more data monopolists, but one prominent
      species among many others in a larger (and complex) ecosystem. What was
      established in the traditional world of legacy data sources (in terms of
      regulations, technologies, practices, etc.) is not guaranteed to be
      sufficient any more with new data sources. Trusted Smart Statistics is not
      about replacing existing sources and processes, but augmenting them with
      new ones. Such augmentation however will not be only incremental: the path
      towards Trusted Smart Statistics is not about tweaking some components of
      the legacy system but about building an entirely new system that will
      coexist with the legacy one. In this position paper we outline some key
      design principles for the new Trusted Smart Statistics system. Taken
      collectively they picture a system where the smart and trust aspects
      enable and reinforce each other. A system that is more extrovert towards
      external stakeholders (citizens, private companies, public authorities)
      with whom Statistical Offices will be sharing computation, control, code,
      logs and of course final statistics, without necessarily sharing the raw
      input data.

AB  - In this discussion paper, we outline the motivations and the main
      principles of the Trusted Smart Statistics (TSS) concept that is under
      development in the European Statistical System. TSS represents the
      evolution of official statistics in response to the challenges posed by
      the new datafied society. Taking stock from the availability of new
      digital data sources, new technologies, and new behaviors, statistical
      offices are called nowadays to rethink the way they operate in order to
      reassert their role in modern democratic society. The issue at stake is
      considerably broader and deeper than merely adapting existing processes to
      embrace so-called Big Data. In several aspects, such evolution entails a
      fundamental paradigm shift with respect to the legacy model of official
      statistics production based on traditional data sources, for example, in
      the relation between data and computation, between data collection and
      analysis, between methodological development and statistical production,
      and of course in the roles of the various stakeholders and their mutual
      relationships. Such complex evolution must be guided by a comprehensive
      system-level view based on clearly spelled design principles. In this
      paper, we aim at providing a general account of the TSS concept reflecting
      the current state of the discussion within the European Statistical
      System.

AB  - The National Statistical Institutes (NSIs) of the European Statistical
      System (ESS) have constantly strived to innovate products, processes and
      methods. Recent developments in the past decade have shown how rapidly
      data ecosystems are evolving across our globalised and digitalised
      societies. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 represented a
      turning point for innovation in the ESS. The speed of change spiked: those
      NSIs that had established a solid ground for innovation managed to
      continue providing high quality statistics to society and policymakers,
      while exploiting the potential for innovation given by the availability of
      new data sources. Despite the pandemic slowly losing its grip, Europe has
      found itself in the middle of a new crisis with the Russian invasion of
      Ukraine. Therefore, NSIs now face the challenge of keeping up the
      innovative work and rolling out these innovations into production. This
      paper provides an overview of the work on innovation done at the ESS level
      in recent years and its contribution to the resilience of the statistical
      system to respond to recent crises. Furthermore, taking stock of recent
      experiences, it presents some of the main challenges and enablers which
      are needed to sustain ESS innovation in the years to come.

AB  - The knowledge of the spatial and temporal distribution of human population
      is vital for the study of cities, disaster risk management or planning of
      infrastructure. However, information on the distribution of population is
      often based on place-of-residence statistics from official sources, thus
      ignoring the changing population densities resulting from human mobility.
      Existing assessments of spatio-temporal population are limited in their
      detail and geographical coverage, and the promising mobile-phone records
      are hindered by issues concerning availability and consistency. Here, we
      present a multi-layered dasymetric approach that combines official
      statistics with geospatial data from emerging sources to produce and
      validate a European Union-wide dataset of population grids taking into
      account intraday and monthly population variations at 1 km2 resolution.
      The results reproduce and systematically quantify known insights
      concerning the spatio-temporal population density structure of large
      European cities, whose daytime population we estimate to be, on average,
      1.9 times higher than night time in city centers.

AB  - Mobile network data has been proven to provide a rich source of
      information in multiple statistical domains such as demography, tourism,
      urban planning, etc. However, the incorporation of this data source to the
      routinely production of official statistics is taking many efforts since a
      diversity of highly entangled issues (access, methodology, IT tools,
      quality, skills) must be solved beforehand. To do this, one-off studies
      with concrete data sets are not enough and a standard statistical
      production process must be put in place. We propose a concrete modular
      process structured into evolvable modules detaching the strongly
      technological layer underlying this data source from the necessary
      statistical analysis producing outputs of interest. This architecture
      follows the principles of the so-called ESS Reference Methodological
      Framework for Mobile Network Data. Each of these modules deals with a
      different aspect of this data source. We apply hidden Markov models for
      the geolocation of mobile devices, use a Bayesian approach on this model
      to disambiguate devices belonging to the same individual, compute
      aggregate numbers of individuals detected by a telecommunication network
      using probability theory, and model hierarchically the integration of
      auxiliary information from the telco market and official data to produce
      final estimates of the number of individuals across different territorial
      regions in the target population. A first simple illustrative proposal has
      been applied to synthetic data providing preliminary software tools and
      accuracy indicators monitoring the performance of the process. Currently,
      this exercise has been applied to the estimation of present population and
      origin-destination matrices. We present an illustrative example of the
      execution of these production modules comparing results with the simulated
      ground truth, thus assessing the performance of each production module.

AB  - Metered data, also called web-tracking data, are generally collected from
      a sample of participants who willingly install or configure, onto their
      devices, technologies that track digital traces left when people go online
      (e.g., URLs visited). Since metered data allow for the observation of
      online behaviours unobtrusively, it has been proposed as a useful tool to
      understand what people do online and what impacts this might have on
      online and offline phenomena. It is crucial, nevertheless, to understand
      its limitations. Although some research have explored the potential errors
      of metered data, a systematic categorisation and conceptualisation of
      these errors are missing. Inspired by the Total Survey Error, we present a
      Total Error framework for digital traces collected with Meters (TEM). The
      TEM framework (1) describes the data generation and the analysis process
      for metered data and (2) documents the sources of bias and variance that
      may arise in each step of this process. Using a case study we also show
      how the TEM can be applied in real life to identify, quantify and reduce
      metered data errors. Results suggest that metered data might indeed be
      affected by the error sources identified in our framework and, to some
      extent, biased. This framework can help improve the quality of both
      stand-alone metered data research projects, as well as foster the
      understanding of how and when survey and metered data can be combined.

AB  - The digitization of human mobility research data and methods can temper
      some shortcomings of traditional approaches, particularly when more
      detailed or timelier data is needed to better address policy issues. We
      critically review the capacity of non-traditional data sources in terms of
      accessibility, availability, populations covered, geographical scope,
      representativeness bias and sensitivity, with special regard to policy
      purposes. We highlight how digital traces about human mobility can assist
      policy-making in relation to issues such as health or the environment
      differently to migration policy, where digital data can lead to
      stereotyped categorizations, unless analysis is carefully tailored to
      account for people’s real needs. In a world where people move for myriad
      reasons and these reasons may vary quickly without being incorporated in
      digital traces, we encourage researchers to constantly assess if what is
      being measured reflects the social phenomenon that the measurement is
      intended to capture and avoids rendering people visible in ways that are
      damaging to their rights and freedoms.

AB  - Big data has been considered to be a breakthrough technological
      development over recent years. Notwithstanding, we have as yet limited
      understanding of how organizations translate its potential into actual
      social and economic value. We conduct an in-depth systematic review of IS
      literature on the topic and identify six debates central to how
      organizations realize value from big data, at different levels of
      analysis. Based on this review, we identify two socio-technical features
      of big data that influence value realization: portability and
      interconnectivity. We argue that, in practice, organizations need to
      continuously realign work practices, organizational models, and
      stakeholder interests in order to reap the benefits from big data. We
      synthesize the findings by means of an integrated model.

AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) suffer from a lack of national
      data needed for effective monitoring and implementation. Almost half of
      the SDG indicators are not regularly produced, and available datasets are
      often out-of-date. New monitoring approaches using big data are advancing
      rapidly and can complement official statistics to help fill critical data
      gaps. However, there is poor information-sharing on the latest innovations
      and research collaborations across different thematic areas, and limited
      evaluation of strengths and weaknesses for supporting national monitoring.
      This paper provides a systematic review of the academic literature over
      the past 5 years relating to the use of big data to support monitoring of
      the SDGs. It reviews the state-of-the-art research using big data and
      advanced analytics to produce new datasets, the alignment of these
      datasets with the official SDG indicators, the main types and sources of
      big data used, and the analytical methods applied. We developed a set of
      evaluation criteria and applied it to highlight some of the strengths and
      limitations of these datasets derived from big data. We find that recent
      research has developed a considerable range of new datasets that could
      contribute to monitoring 15 goals, 51 targets, and 69 indicators. Dominant
      focal areas of research include land and biodiversity, health, water,
      cities and settlements, and poverty. Satellite and Earth Observation data
      were the primary sources used, most commonly applied with machine learning
      methods and cloud computing. However, several challenges remain, including
      ensuring the relevance of new datasets for monitoring SDG indicators, cost
      and accessibility considerations, sustainability aspects, and linking
      global datasets to nationally owned monitoring processes.

AB  - Abstract With the increase of social media usage, a huge new source of
      data has become available. Despite the enthusiasm linked to this
      revolution, one of the main outstanding criticisms in using these data is
      selection bias. Indeed, the reference population is unknown. Nevertheless,
      many studies show evidence that these data constitute a valuable source
      because they are more timely and possess higher space granularity. We
      propose to adjust statistics based on Twitter data by anchoring them to
      reliable official statistics through a weighted, space-time, small area
      estimation model. As a by-product, the proposed method also stabilizes the
      social media indicators, which is a welcome property required for official
      statistics. The method can be adapted anytime official statistics exists
      at the proper level of granularity and for which social media usage within
      the population is known. As an example, we adjust a subjective well-being
      indicator of “working conditions” in Italy, and combine it with relevant
      official statistics. The weights depend on broadband coverage and the
      Twitter rate at province level, while the analysis is performed at
      regional level. The resulting statistics are then compared with survey
      statistics on the “quality of job” at macro-economic regional level,
      showing evidence of similar paths.

AB  - Big Data often presents as massive nonprobability samples. Not only is the
      selection mechanism often unknown but larger data volume amplifies the
      relative contribution of selection bias to total error. Existing bias
      adjustment approaches assume that the conditional mean structures have
      been correctly specified for the selection indicator or key substantive
      measures. In the presence of a reference probability sample, these methods
      rely on a pseudolikelihood method to account for the sampling weights of
      the reference sample, which is parametric in nature. Under a Bayesian
      framework, handling the sampling weights is an even bigger hurdle. To
      further protect against model misspecification, we expand the idea of
      double robustness such that more flexible nonparametric methods as well as
      Bayesian models can be used for prediction. In particular, we employ
      Bayesian additive regression trees which not only capture nonlinear
      associations automatically but permit direct quantification of the
      uncertainty of point estimates through its posterior predictive draws. We
      apply our method to sensor-based naturalistic driving data from the second
      Strategic Highway Research Program using the 2017 National Household
      Travel Survey as a benchmark.

AB  - The information fusion field has recently been attracting a lot of
      interest within the scientific community, as it provides, through the
      combination of different sources of heterogeneous information, a fuller
      and/or more precise understanding of the real world than can be gained
      considering the above sources separately. One of the fundamental aims of
      computer systems, and especially decision support systems, is to assure
      that the quality of the information they process is high. There are many
      different approaches for this purpose, including information fusion.
      Information fusion is currently one of the most promising methods. It is
      particularly useful under circumstances where quality might be
      compromised, for example, either intrinsically due to imperfect
      information (vagueness, uncertainty, …) or because of limited resources
      (energy, time, …). In response to this goal, a wide range of research has
      been undertaken over recent years. To date, the literature reviews in this
      field have focused on problem-specific issues and have been circumscribed
      to certain system types. Therefore, there is no holistic and systematic
      knowledge of the state of the art to help establish the steps to be taken
      in the future. In particular, aspects like what impact different
      information fusion methods have on information quality, how information
      quality is characterised, measured and evaluated in different application
      domains depending on the problem data type or whether fusion is designed
      as a flexible process capable of adapting to changing system circumstances
      and their intrinsically limited resources have not been addressed. This
      paper aims precisely to review the literature on research into the use of
      information fusion techniques specifically to improve information quality,
      analysing the above issues in order to identify a series of challenges and
      research directions, which are presented in this paper.

AB  - ABSTRACTSince 2006, representative telephone surveys among the German
      general population have not detected any significant changes with respect
      to gambling-related problems. This is remarkable, as in the meantime not
      only the availability of gambling services and the turnover and gross
      gambling revenues of gambling providers have increased, but also the
      demand for treatment from people with gambling problems has grown. Not
      only in the gambling field have population surveys of this type recently
      been associated with certain methodological problems. These include a
      decreasing willingness to participate among and limited access to specific
      subgroups. The prevalence study at hand is based on a mixed-mode design
      which combines both a telephone and an online survey. The weighting of
      both samples in a ratio of 2 to 1 was checked against plausibility data.
      The sample consists of 12,303 complete interviews (telephone: 61%, online:
      39%). The results show that 2.3% of the German population aged 18?70?years
      are identified as having a ?gambling disorder? according to DSM-5 (mild
      disorder: 1.1%, moderate disorder: 0.7%, and severe disorder: 0.5%). The
      prevalence detected in this study is significantly higher than that of
      previous surveys. Finally, we discuss the results primarily within the
      context of the new survey methodology.

AB  - With the consolidation of the culture of evidence-based policymaking, the
      availability of data has become central to policymakers. Nowadays,
      innovative data sources offer an opportunity to describe demographic,
      mobility, and migratory phenomena more accurately by making available
      large volumes of real-time and spatially detailed data. At the same time,
      however, data innovation has led to new challenges (ethics, privacy, data
      governance models, data quality) for citizens, statistical offices,
      policymakers and the private sector. Focusing on the fields of demography,
      mobility, and migration studies, the aim of this report is to assess the
      current state of data innovation in the scientific literature as well as
      to identify areas in which data innovation has the most concrete potential
      for policymaking. Consequently, this study has reviewed more than 300
      articles and scientific reports, as well as numerous tools, that employed
      non-traditional data sources to measure vital population events
      (mortality, fertility), migration and human mobility, and the population
      change and population distribution. The specific findings of our report
      form the basis of a discussion on a) how innovative data is used compared
      to traditional data sources; b) domains in which innovative data have the
      greatest potential to contribute to policymaking; c) the prospects of
      innovative data transition towards systematically contributing to official
      statistics and policymaking.

AB  - The proliferation of disconnected information systems accumulating
      increasing volumes of heterogeneous data is a formidable challenge in the
      healthcare domain. It is necessary to address this challenge as the entire
      domain gradually transitions into e-healthcare and patient-centered
      healthcare delivery models. The lack of data integration at systems level
      prohibits clinicians from building a comprehensive understanding of the
      patient condition and further deprives patients of developing a holistic
      awareness of their medical conditions. In this paper, we propose an open
      data integration platform for patient, clinical, medical and historical
      data siloed across multiple health information systems. As an open
      platform, it can accommodate and integrate further heterogeneous data
      sources such as data streams generated by wearable IoT devices. As an
      integration platform, it facilitates the centralization of data assets.
      This centralization empowers every stakeholder in a patient-centered care
      setting to actively participate in decision-making. A range of analytics
      and reporting solutions, such as data warehouse, interactive dashboards,
      and predictive analytics tools, can be deployed upon this open data
      integration platform. The proposed platform is currently being adapted and
      implemented to address patient-centered healthcare and clinical decision
      support requirements in a sports injury clinic at a not-for-profit private
      hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Use Case based demonstration of the
      platform’s suitability for holistic information management, decision
      support, and predictive analytics justify its role in the advancement of
      e-healthcare.
