  abstract  = "AbstractMore and more surveys are conducted online. While web
               surveys are generally cheaper and tend to have lower measurement
               error in comparison to other survey modes, especially for
               sensitive questions, potential advantages might be offset by
               larger nonresponse bias. This article compares the data quality
               in a web survey administration to another common mode of survey
               administration, the telephone.The unique feature of this study
               is the availability of administrative records for all sampled
               individuals in combination with a random assignment of survey
               mode. This specific design allows us to investigate and compare
               potential bias in survey statistics due to 1) nonresponse error,
               2) measurement error, and 3) combined bias of these two error
               sources and hence, an overall assessment of data quality for two
               common modes of survey administration, telephone and web.Our
               results show that overall mean estimates on the web are more
               biased compared to the telephone mode. Nonresponse and
               measurement bias tend to reinforce each other in both modes,
               with nonresponse bias being somewhat more pronounced in the web
               mode. While measurement error bias tends to be smaller in the
               web survey implementation, interestingly, our results also show

  abstract    = "OBJECTIVE: Household budget survey (HBS) data are used
                 regularly for nutritional epidemiological purposes. The
                 validity of HBS data, however, is not well established. The
                 aim of this project was to compare HBS and individual
                 nutrition survey (INS) data in a nationally representative
                 sample of Polish households. DESIGN: Estimates of food
                 consumption and nutrient intake were compared between
                 household food acquisition data collected over 1 month and a
                 single 24-hour recall collected from every household member in
                 a nationally representative sample of Polish households
                 surveyed between September and November 2000. To facilitate
                 the comparison, INS food consumption data excluded food eaten
                 away from home and were modified using a computer program to
                 estimate food 'as purchased' (including disaggregation of
                 recipe data) and to allow for wastage. SETTING: Poland.
                 SUBJECTS: Participants were 3716 individuals in 1215
                 households (representing co-operation rates of 86.2\% and
                 89.2\%, respectively). RESULTS: Good agreement was shown
                 between median estimates of foods such as potatoes, vegetables
                 (including processed), meat, meat products and poultry, and
                 animal fats (excluding butter), but agreement was poor for
                 bread and rolls, fruit, vegetable fats and oils, eggs and six
                 other food groups. Estimates of energy and nutrient intake
                 were within +/-10\% with the exceptions of polyunsaturated
                 fats, potassium and vitamin C. CONCLUSIONS: Possible reasons
                 for differences in findings between the two surveys include
                 survey bias (e.g. social approval bias leading to
                 overreporting of fruit), seasonal variations (e.g. high potato
                 purchases between September and November) and aspects of the
                 methodology (e.g. HBS data were based on records collected
                 over 1 month, whereas 24-hour recall data were based on
                 recalls collected from all household respondents on only 1 day
                 and averaged for each household type). HBSs provide useful
                 data for epidemiological research, but findings need to be
                 interpreted in the light of other data regarding consumption,
                 and numerous factors that may affect consumption need to be
                 taken into account.",

  abstract  = "The time-use diary is a complex and burdensome data collection
               instrument. This can negatively affect data quality, leading to
               less detailed and/or inaccurate activity reporting as the
               surveyed time period unfolds. However, it can also be argued
               that data quality may actually improve over time as respondents
               become more familiar with the diary instrument format and more
               interested in the diary task. These competing hypotheses have
               only been partially tested on data from paper and
               telephone-administered diaries, which are traditionally used for
               large-scale data collection. Less is known about
               self-administered modes that make use of new technologies,
               despite their increasing popularity among researchers. This
               research note rectifies this omission by comparing diary quality
               in self-administered web and app diaries, drawing on data from
               the Millennium Cohort Study. We construct a person-level data
               quality typology, using information on missing data, episode
               changes, and reporting of key daily activity domains. Results
               show significant mode differences on person-level data quality,
               after controlling for characteristics known to influence diary
               mode selection and data quality. App diarists were more likely
               to return two diaries of inconsistent quality. Both respondent
               fatigue and improvement of completion over time appear more
               common among app diarists.",

               personal intercept interviews and online questionnaires to meet
               the basic requirements of a survey: good data quality,
               representativeness and minimal costs. Five application case
               studies in European cities are presented to evaluate and
               demonstrate the validity of the method and to study people's
               willingness to complete a survey. The successful application of
               the method in a variety of research projects proves its validity
               for survey campaigns to assess different transport policies. The
               results evidence the validity of the methodology. The response
               rates obtained were quite high compared with merely online
               surveys -- between 14 and 22\% -- and the data collected met the
               quality requirements for each research project where the method
               was applied. The method combines low cost, reliability and high
               response rates and therefore clearly contributes to mobility

               data sources and the geospatial data from emerging,
               unconventional, yet disparate, sources and formats. The project
               showcases different applications of this concept relevant to the
               assessment of human activity at European scale. Underpinning
               each application in the thesis is the research question: How can
               geospatial data from diverse sources and with different
               properties be combined to enhance the spatial representation of
               human activity? The thesis focuses on developing an ensemble of
               data fusion protocols to integrate geospatial data from both
               conventional and unconventional data sources with very different
               characteristics into consistent data frameworks to fill specific
               data, information and knowledge gaps. Within the geospatial
               sciences, data fusion has been used mainly in the remote sensing
               domain. This project tries to unlock the potential of data
               fusion for a broader set of geographical information science
               applications, with focus areas on land use (Chapters 2, 3, 4),

               distribution (Chapters 7, 8). The outcomes stretch beyond the

                 for example increased resolution, better timeliness, and new
                 statistical outputs. But there are also many challenges:
                 uncontrolled changes in sources that threaten continuity, lack
                 of identifiers that impedes linking to population frames, and
                 data that refers only indirectly to phenomena of statistical
                 interest. We discuss two approaches to deal with these
                 challenges and opportunities. First, we may accept big data
                 for what they are: an imperfect, yet timely, indicator of
                 phenomena in society. These data exist and that's whythey are
                 interesting. Secondly, we may extend this approach by
                 explicitmodelling. New methods like machine-learning
                 techniques can be considered alongside more traditional
                 methods like Bayesian techniques. National statistical
                 institutes have always been reluctant to use models, apart
                 from specific cases like small-area estimates. Based on the
                 experience at Statistics Netherlands we argue that NSIs should
                 not be afraid to use models, provided that their use is
                 documented and made transparent to users. Moreover, the
                 primary purpose of an NSI is to describe society; we should
                 refrain from making forecasts. The models used should
                 therefore rely on actually observed data and they should be
                 validated extensively.",

               and environmental big data that are published as open data or
               were made available to the project for Dublin, Ireland. These
               data were systematically explored through a process of data
               checking and wrangling, building tools to display and analyse
               the data, and evaluating them with respect to 16 measures of
               their suitability: access, sustainability and reliability,
               transparency and interpretability, privacy, fidelity,
               cleanliness, completeness, spatial granularity, temporal

               key performance indicators and potential new official

  abstract  = "In this contribution we outline the concept of Trusted Smart
               Statistics as the natural evolution of official statistics in
               the new datafied world. Traditional data sources, namely survey
               and administrative data, represent nowadays a valuable but small
               portion of the global data stock, much thereof being held in the
               private sector. The availability of new data sources is only one
               aspect of the global change that concerns official statistics.
               Other aspects, more subtle but not less important, include the
               changes in perceptions, expectations, behaviours and relations
               between the stakeholders. The environment around official
               statistics has changed: statistical offices are not any more
               data monopolists, but one prominent species among many others in
               a larger (and complex) ecosystem. What was established in the
               traditional world of legacy data sources (in terms of
               regulations, technologies, practices, etc.) is not guaranteed to
               be sufficient any more with new data sources. Trusted Smart
               Statistics is not about replacing existing sources and
               processes, but augmenting them with new ones. Such augmentation
               however will not be only incremental: the path towards Trusted
               Smart Statistics is not about tweaking some components of the
               legacy system but about building an entirely new system that
               will coexist with the legacy one. In this position paper we
               outline some key design principles for the new Trusted Smart
               Statistics system. Taken collectively they picture a system
               where the smart and trust aspects enable and reinforce each
               other. A system that is more extrovert towards external
               stakeholders (citizens, private companies, public authorities)
               with whom Statistical Offices will be sharing computation,
               control, code, logs and of course final statistics, without
               necessarily sharing the raw input data.",

               main principles of the Trusted Smart Statistics (TSS) concept
               that is under development in the European Statistical System.
               TSS represents the evolution of official statistics in response
               to the challenges posed by the new datafied society. Taking
               stock from the availability of new digital data sources, new
               technologies, and new behaviors, statistical offices are called
               nowadays to rethink the way they operate in order to reassert
               their role in modern democratic society. The issue at stake is
               considerably broader and deeper than merely adapting existing
               processes to embrace so-called Big Data. In several aspects,
               such evolution entails a fundamental paradigm shift with respect
               to the legacy model of official statistics production based on
               traditional data sources, for example, in the relation between
               data and computation, between data collection and analysis,
               between methodological development and statistical production,
               and of course in the roles of the various stakeholders and their
               mutual relationships. Such complex evolution must be guided by a
               comprehensive system-level view based on clearly spelled design
               principles. In this paper, we aim at providing a general account

               decade have shown how rapidly data ecosystems are evolving
               across our globalised and digitalised societies. The outbreak of
               the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 represented a turning point for
               innovation in the ESS. The speed of change spiked: those NSIs

               continue providing high quality statistics to society and
               policymakers, while exploiting the potential for innovation

               middle of a new crisis with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
               Therefore, NSIs now face the challenge of keeping up the
               innovative work and rolling out these innovations into
               production. This paper provides an overview of the work on
               innovation done at the ESS level in recent years and its

                 human population is vital for the study of cities, disaster
                 risk management or planning of infrastructure. However,
                 information on the distribution of population is often based
                 on place-of-residence statistics from official sources, thus

               information in multiple statistical domains such as demography,
               tourism, urban planning, etc. However, the incorporation of this
               data source to the routinely production of official statistics
               is taking many efforts since a diversity of highly entangled
               issues (access, methodology, IT tools, quality, skills) must be
               solved beforehand. To do this, one-off studies with concrete
               data sets are not enough and a standard statistical production
               process must be put in place. We propose a concrete modular
               process structured into evolvable modules detaching the strongly
               technological layer underlying this data source from the
               necessary statistical analysis producing outputs of interest.
               This architecture follows the principles of the so-called ESS
               Reference Methodological Framework for Mobile Network Data. Each
               of these modules deals with a different aspect of this data
               source. We apply hidden Markov models for the geolocation of
               mobile devices, use a Bayesian approach on this model to
               disambiguate devices belonging to the same individual, compute
               aggregate numbers of individuals detected by a telecommunication
               network using probability theory, and model hierarchically the
               integration of auxiliary information from the telco market and
               official data to produce final estimates of the number of
               individuals across different territorial regions in the target
               population. A first simple illustrative proposal has been
               applied to synthetic data providing preliminary software tools

  abstract    = "Metered data, also called web-tracking data, are generally
                 collected from a sample of participants who willingly install
                 or configure, onto their devices, technologies that track
                 digital traces left when people go online (e.g., URLs
                 visited). Since metered data allow for the observation of
                 online behaviours unobtrusively, it has been proposed as a
                 useful tool to understand what people do online and what
                 impacts this might have on online and offline phenomena. It is
                 crucial, nevertheless, to understand its limitations. Although
                 some research have explored the potential errors of metered
                 data, a systematic categorisation and conceptualisation of
                 these errors are missing. Inspired by the Total Survey Error,
                 we present a Total Error framework for digital traces
                 collected with Meters (TEM). The TEM framework (1) describes
                 the data generation and the analysis process for metered data
                 and (2) documents the sources of bias and variance that may
                 arise in each step of this process. Using a case study we also
                 show how the TEM can be applied in real life to identify,
                 quantify and reduce metered data errors. Results suggest that
                 metered data might indeed be affected by the error sources
                 identified in our framework and, to some extent, biased. This
                 framework can help improve the quality of both stand-alone
                 metered data research projects, as well as foster the

  abstract  = "Abstract With the increase of social media usage, a huge new
               source of data has become available. Despite the enthusiasm
               linked to this revolution, one of the main outstanding
               criticisms in using these data is selection bias. Indeed, the
               reference population is unknown. Nevertheless, many studies show
               evidence that these data constitute a valuable source because
               they are more timely and possess higher space granularity. We
               propose to adjust statistics based on Twitter data by anchoring
               them to reliable official statistics through a weighted,
               space-time, small area estimation model. As a by-product, the
               proposed method also stabilizes the social media indicators,
               which is a welcome property required for official statistics.
               The method can be adapted anytime official statistics exists at
               the proper level of granularity and for which social media usage
               within the population is known. As an example, we adjust a
               subjective well-being indicator of ``working conditions'' in
               Italy, and combine it with relevant official statistics. The
               weights depend on broadband coverage and the Twitter rate at
               province level, while the analysis is performed at regional
               level. The resulting statistics are then compared with survey
               statistics on the ``quality of job'' at macro-economic regional
               level, showing evidence of similar paths.",

               conditional mean structures have been correctly specified for
               the selection indicator or key substantive measures. In the
               presence of a reference probability sample, these methods rely
               on a pseudolikelihood method to account for the sampling weights

               of interest within the scientific community, as it provides,
               through the combination of different sources of heterogeneous
               information, a fuller and/or more precise understanding of the
               real world than can be gained considering the above sources
               separately. One of the fundamental aims of computer systems, and
               especially decision support systems, is to assure that the
               quality of the information they process is high. There are many
               different approaches for this purpose, including information
               fusion. Information fusion is currently one of the most
               promising methods. It is particularly useful under circumstances
               where quality might be compromised, for example, either
               intrinsically due to imperfect information (vagueness,
               uncertainty, …) or because of limited resources (energy, time,
               …). In response to this goal, a wide range of research has been
               undertaken over recent years. To date, the literature reviews in
               this field have focused on problem-specific issues and have been
               circumscribed to certain system types. Therefore, there is no
               holistic and systematic knowledge of the state of the art to
               help establish the steps to be taken in the future. In
               particular, aspects like what impact different information
               fusion methods have on information quality, how information
               quality is characterised, measured and evaluated in different
               application domains depending on the problem data type or
               whether fusion is designed as a flexible process capable of
               adapting to changing system circumstances and their
               intrinsically limited resources have not been addressed. This
               paper aims precisely to review the literature on research into
               the use of information fusion techniques specifically to improve

               treatment from people with gambling problems has grown. Not only

                   policymaking, the availability of data has become central to
                   policymakers. Nowadays, innovative data sources offer an
                   opportunity to describe demographic, mobility, and migratory
                   phenomena more accurately by making available large volumes
                   of real-time and spatially detailed data. At the same time,
                   however, data innovation has led to new challenges (ethics,
                   privacy, data governance models, data quality) for citizens,
                   statistical offices, policymakers and the private sector.
                   Focusing on the fields of demography, mobility, and
                   migration studies, the aim of this report is to assess the
                   current state of data innovation in the scientific
                   literature as well as to identify areas in which data
                   innovation has the most concrete potential for policymaking.
                   Consequently, this study has reviewed more than 300 articles
                   and scientific reports, as well as numerous tools, that
                   employed non-traditional data sources to measure vital
                   population events (mortality, fertility), migration and
                   human mobility, and the population change and population
                   distribution. The specific findings of our report form the
                   basis of a discussion on a) how innovative data is used
                   compared to traditional data sources; b) domains in which
                   innovative data have the greatest potential to contribute to
                   policymaking; c) the prospects of innovative data transition
                   towards systematically contributing to official statistics
                   and policymaking.",

  abstract = "The proliferation of disconnected information systems
              accumulating increasing volumes of heterogeneous data is a
              formidable challenge in the healthcare domain. It is necessary to
              address this challenge as the entire domain gradually transitions
              into e-healthcare and patient-centered healthcare delivery
              models. The lack of data integration at systems level prohibits
              clinicians from building a comprehensive understanding of the
              patient condition and further deprives patients of developing a
              holistic awareness of their medical conditions. In this paper, we
              propose an open data integration platform for patient, clinical,
              medical and historical data siloed across multiple health
              information systems. As an open platform, it can accommodate and
              integrate further heterogeneous data sources such as data streams
              generated by wearable IoT devices. As an integration platform, it
              facilitates the centralization of data assets. This
              centralization empowers every stakeholder in a patient-centered
              care setting to actively participate in decision-making. A range
              of analytics and reporting solutions, such as data warehouse,
              interactive dashboards, and predictive analytics tools, can be
              deployed upon this open data integration platform. The proposed
              platform is currently being adapted and implemented to address
              patient-centered healthcare and clinical decision support
              requirements in a sports injury clinic at a not-for-profit
              private hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Use Case based
              demonstration of the platform's suitability for holistic
              information management, decision support, and predictive
              analytics justify its role in the advancement of e-healthcare.",
